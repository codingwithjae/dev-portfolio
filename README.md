## Welcome to my most recent portfolio repository from a Front End Mentor challenge! ðŸ‘‹

This is a solution to the [Single-page developer portfolio](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/singlepage-developer-portfolio-bBVj2ZPi-x/hub).

Frontend Mentor challenges help to improve coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Hook the form up so it sends and stores the user's inquiry (you can use a spreadsheet or Airtable to save the inquiries)
- **Bonus**: Add your own details (image, skills, projects) to replace the ones in the design

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup.
- Flexbox.
- CSS Grid.
- Vanilla JavaScript.
- Mobile-first design.

### What I learned

- I use the original Front End Mentor Project for making my portfolio.
- This project was done with mobile-first in mind. Was a great exercise for doing layout and for putting into practice Javascript concepts with the validation form. In future updates, I would implement Airtable on the website.

### What can be improve

- The validation form code still needs some work.
- HTML can be enhanced.
